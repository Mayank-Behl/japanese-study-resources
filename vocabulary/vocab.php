                    can definitely can understand why is he so good at those complex kanji and vocabulary where I often struggle to recall. I'd quote his words now "Their process is so very immersing and interesting that you can't resist learning every day. I think I would be stuck in the beginner phase if I had not found out about WaniKani."
                    But hey! don't loose motivation if do not want to pay for it, the above mentioned resources are equally good. Everybody's got a personal preference.

It uses the interactive lessons to teach Japanese grammar with vocabulary where the learner would first learn about each grammar point in every lesson and then would be tested on the same. 
                    It uses various really fun and immersive exercises to test the learner, this is really helpful as it sticks the grammar point and the vocabulary associated in long term memory. Each lesson and the sentences that they use to explain the grammar point is backed up by native audio, learning by audio definitely helps a lot.
                    Each lesson have these really helpful learning tips which I highly recommend going through this before any lesson, going through them just once would significantly boost your lesson learning speed and retaining quality.

They do offer advanced learning procedures and techniques but for those advanced techniques you would have to pay for the membership. But the lectures are same for both free and paid. 
                    <b> Learners of JLPT level N5 and N4 in my opinion must go through this before anything else. </b> This will build a perfect foundation of Japanese grammar for you. There is an app for both Android and iOS (check the app section).

                  <p class="website-detail">This is the best dictionary that I have found over the internet. I use Jisho when I stumble upon a kanji that I don't know or remember. By just simply using the search feature even in Romaji you can find out the meaning word and even the meaning of individual kanji can be found on the right side of the window. 
                    <br> As it is completely free, I almost use it on daily basis while reading something if I stumble upon some kanji which I can't read then by taking the help of the Furigana (hiragana characters written above kanji) and type them in romaji/hiragana in the search box and find out the meaning of the kanji as well as the meaning of individual kanji. This might not seem too much helpful but next time when you stumble upon same word the chances of you reading it correctly are definitely better.

It covers almost everything with <b> JLPT N5 and N4 level</b>. This book is divided into various chapters which are based on categories, for example- Weather is a chapter in this book, this chapter will have the kanji that are related to this category, similarly another category like School, Health and many more. <br>  It uses this <b> batch technique </b>(I like to call it this) where you can easily remember the kanji related to the specific categories. So when, a category pops up you know what all possible kanji there could be related to it. Also, you get to practice whilst learning as the book gives you practice boxes associated with each kanji for every chapter.
                  Moreover, this book uses the mnemonics to teach so there is a much better chance to remember the kanji with a short story associated with it, or you could create some mnemonics by yourself as well.
                  At the end of the chapter there are practice exercise which tests you out your ability.

                <p class="website-detail">As the name suggests the Shin Kanzen Master will definitely help you master the vocab with their book. This book is divided into chapters and gives the reader a lot of practice exercises. 
                  
                 <b> I would recommend using Shin Kanzen Master from JLPT N3 and after </b> because the lower levels do not require that much of practice that these books offer.
                  The amount of practice and vast variety of vocabulary that this book offers is very remarkable, going through the book twice would make you quite comfortable with JLPT N3 vocabulary.
