                  <p class="website-detail">StudyKanji is perfect for the revision of Kanji. There is the option to select the level of JLPT kanji you want to study. After selecting the level all the concerned kanji for that level would be displayed, by clicking any of the kanji the details of the particular kanji are showed with all the readings related to it. I often use this website for a quick review of the kanji for previous level of JLPT, whenever I feel like I am missing out kanji from the past level I just take a week or two to go through all the previous levels. This process I do approximately once in every four months. So, for reviewing kanji I am putting this website on the list.

Ranging from a variety of study methods whether be it through flashcard, by drawing the kanji or even just by memorizing Kanshudo is the prefect website for anyone to start the Japanese learning journey. Even if you have been studying Japanese for a while and you are confident in your skills Kanshudo offers the Play mode to test yourself out. 
                    <br>Also, there are the statistics  of the learning you have done and the progress you have made. The website has a lot to offer ranging from kanji, grammar, vocabulary, dictionary and the tests.
                    I'm pretty much sure you are going to like this one.

                  <p class="website-detail">This is the best dictionary that I have found over the internet. I use Jisho when I stumble upon a kanji that I don't know or remember. By just simply using the search feature even in Romaji you can find out the meaning word and even the meaning of individual kanji can be found on the right side of the window. 
                   <br> As it is completely free, I almost use it on daily basis while reading something if I stumble upon some kanji which I can't read then by taking the help of the Furigana (hiragana characters written above kanji) and type them in romaji/hiragana in the search box and find out the meaning of the kanji as well as the meaning of individual kanji. This might not seem too much helpful but next time when you stumble upon same word the chances of you reading it correctly are definitely better.

This book is divided into various chapters which are based on categories, for example- Weather is a chapter in this book, this chapter will have the kanji that are related to this category, similarly another category like School, Health and many more. <br>  It uses this <b> batch technique </b>(I like to call it this) where you can easily remember the kanji related to the specific categories. So when, a category pops up you know what all possible kanji there could be related to it. Also, you get to practice whilst learning as the book gives you practice boxes associated with each kanji for every chapter.
                  Moreover, this book uses the mnemonics to teach so there is a much better chance to remember the kanji with a short story associated with it, or you could create some mnemonics by yourself as well.
                  At the end of the chapter there are practice exercise which tests you out your ability.

                <p class="website-detail">Nihongo So Matome is very good for practicing vocabulary. The book is a weekly lesson based book which covers a few vocab associated with that topic of the day and teaches how those can be used. There are total 6 weeks and each week has 7 days worth of lesson, where lesson 1st to 6th day of each week will teach you some new vocabulary and then test you out with a test at the end of each day lesson. On the 7th day it is compilation test of all the previous days of the week. 
               <br> <b>  I would recommend using Nihongo So Matome from JLPT N3 and after because the lower levels do not require that much of practice that these books offer. </b> <br>
                With a lot of exercises this books helps you practice a lot and get used to use a specific word in what situation. It has a lot of questions which make you accustomed to JLPT question pattern.
