                <p class="website-detail">Nihongo Challenge is a very good book as it makes you practice a lot, but it doesn't give that much detailed explanation within the book itself. So, it is accompanied by a supplementary book which comes along the main book. This supplementary book has complete explanation of each grammar point, all the translations of the sentences are inside this book as well as the answers to the text section resides within this supplementary book. 
                 <br> This book take real life example for teaching and definitely very good, this completely prepare you for JLPT. 
                   
                  <b> But this book is only for JLPT N4 . </b>

The book has the detailed explanation of each and every grammar point, explaining how the sentences would be formed where all the grammar can be used and in which all conditions the grammar shouldn't be used. 
                <br>  This book makes you practice a lot after every chapter there is exercise and after every few chapters there is a compilation exercise. These exercises are indeed very challenging thus, making this book perfect for higher level studying. This book has the type of questions that are being asked in the JLPT and gives you adequate knowledge of all the grammatical questions that could come in the exam.
                  I highly recommend this book if you just want to start with the higher level of grammar.

                <p class="website-detail">Minna no Nihongo will introduce a huge test: it's everything in Japanese. What's more, we don't signify "there's no romaji," the whole book is in Japanese. You need a different "interpretation book" in English to concentrate appropriately.
                  The two book framework isn't "awful," fundamentally. Concentrating with the primary, all-Japanese course book will drive you to make sense of things through setting and think carefully somewhat more. You can generally check the interpretation book for punctuation clarifications when you stall out.
                  Minna no Nihongo is very inside and out as well. It covers a ton of material and utilize complex terms to instruct language structure focuses. It even clarifies pitch highlights with new punctuation you learn! This is extraordinary on the grounds that pitch highlight ought to be learned early however not many course readings spread it.
                  <br>
                  After finishing the first Minna no Nihongo, you'll know more than if you'd examined Genki I. In case you're progressively scholastic and need to learn however much as could be expected, this is an incredible alternative for you since you can take as much time as is needed and absorb the information. In the event that you hit a barricade, a guide or language accomplice would function admirably with this course reading.
