As it is completely free, I almost use it on daily basis while i am reading something i stumble upon some kanji which I can't read I then I take the help of the Furigana (hiragana characters written above kanji) and type them in romaji/hiragana in the search box and find out the meaning of the kanji as well as the meaning of individual kanji.
